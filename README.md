# Next-POI-prediction

This project presents an advanced model for next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation, leveraging two Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to handle spatial data and an LSTM to exploit temporal dependecies. By incorporating user clustering and embedding cluster centroids, the model captures shared POI preferences among similar users, improving prediction accuracy.

'Next-POI.ipynb' contains the code used for this task, from preprocessing to training.
'Report.pdf' is a report showing choices and planning implementations.
'NextPOI presentation.pptx' is a small presentation about the project.
'data' folder contains the preprocessed data.
Dataset used: 'TSMC2014 dataset', New-York check-ins
